# Straights
Card Game made with C++ from scratch as part of my Object Oriented Programming course.

# Rules
A Four player card game, where players can be either humans or computers. 
Each turn, a player can view the deck, play a card, discard a card or quit the game.
Each time a player discards a card, the card value is added to their points.
The player with the lowest score wins the game.
If a player quits during the game, a computer takes over for the player.
The game also prevents players from making any kind of illegal play.
